&amp;mdash; K. Z. Howell (@KZ_Howell) March 27, 2020  I think we can all agree that it&amp;rsquo;s been a wild year. And while it&amp;rsquo;s been utterly exhausting, it&amp;rsquo;s been amazing in its own way.
With that said, some stories I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing here - others will be shared on my other blog.</description>

      <description>about me  Currently, I&#39;m working with the great team over at the The Engine Room as their Technical Project Manager. The Engine Room helps activists, organisations, and other social change agents make the most of data and technology to increase their impact. I&#39;m also co-founder at Pueblo CoLab - a collaborative aiming to help social innovators around the world do good work.
Surprisingly, I still spend a lot of time living out of my suitcase but feel most at home in Cape Town, Brooklyn or Costa Rica.</description>
